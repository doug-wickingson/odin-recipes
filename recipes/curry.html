            <h3>Steps</h3>
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt. Heat oil in a large skillet
                over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until
                completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and
                set aside.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining
                in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8
                minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon
                of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while
                stirring.</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the
                mixture; stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour in
                1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce.
                Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</li>
            <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the
                center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
                inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
                Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.</li>
        </ol>
