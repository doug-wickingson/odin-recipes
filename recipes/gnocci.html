    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot boil the unpeeled potatoes until tender, remove from the pot and let cool
            remove the skin. Then pass through a potato ricer. Yukon gold or russet are best. 1 pound
            potatoes (Yukon gold or russet are best) (½ kilo)</li>
        <li>Mix together the flour and salt, place on a flat surface, make a well in the middle and add the potatoes and
            egg, mix together with your fingers to form a soft dough, it should not stick to your fingers. On a lightly
            floured surface, cut small amounts of dough to form ropes and cut into ¾ inch (2 cm) pieces, then slide each
            piece on a fork and squeeze a little (but not too hard). Sprinkle with a little bit of flour and toss, so
            they don't stick together. Let the gnocchi rest for 20 minutes before cooking. 1 cup flour (125 grams), ½
            teaspoon salt, 1 medium egg (room temperature),</li>
        <li>While the gnocchi are resting make the sauce. In a large saucepan add olive oil, tomatoes, salt, garlic,
            oregano, basil, hot pepper flakes and water, stir to combine, half cover and let simmer over medium heat
            until thickened. Remove cover for the last few minutes to thicken. 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 can pelati
            tomatoes with sauce (1½ to 2 cups / 400 grams), nothing else added in the tomatoes, ½ teaspoon salt, 1-2
            cloves large of garlic chopped, 1 teaspoons oregano, 5 leaves basil chopped (or 1 teaspoon dried), 2 dashes
            of hot pepper flakes (if desired), ½ cup water</li>
        <li>In a large pot of salted boiling water cook the gnocchi, gnocchi are ready when they float to the top. Drain
            and add to the cooked sauce, add a little pasta water, cook for 30 seconds, gently tossing. Serve
            immediately topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese if desired. Enjoy!</li>
